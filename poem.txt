In the hush between the beating hours,
Where moonlight spills on sleeping flowers,
Dreams drift soft like silver streams,
Weaving worlds from whispered dreams.

The night holds secrets, still and deep,
That only wake when others sleep.
And in that space, so vast, so farâ€”
You find yourself, among the stars.
